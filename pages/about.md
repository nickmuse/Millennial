I am a Cyber Security Engineer and Independent Game Developer from Mastic Beach NY.

I enjoy drives east, drives west, architecture, design, nuance, watercolor, nature, old cities, geopolitical history, literature, thrifting, f1, film, a game of chess, late summer ferries, the stillness after it snows, taking things apart to see how they work, and sharing my snacks.
