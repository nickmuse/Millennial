I am a game developer and cyber security engineer from the greater New York area.

I appreciate humilty, curiosity and those with the innate ability to goof off.

I enjoy drives east, drives west, architecture, design, watercolor, nature, cities, foods, history, literature, thrifting, f1, film, chess, late summer ferries, the stillness after it snows, dryheat, taking things apart to see how they work, and sharing my snacks.
