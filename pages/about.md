I am a security engineer and developer from Mastic Beach NY.
<br><br>
I enjoy drives east, drives west, architecture, design, nature, old cities, geopolitical history, literature, thrifting, f1, film, a game of chess, late summer ferries, the stillness after it snows, sports with my friends, taking things apart to see how they work.
