Working with Noisy Bug Studios to bring FEWAR-DVD online was an incredible experience that allowed me to contribute to one of my favorite pieces of art.

I helped code the input system, the menus, the tech art (angular lighting, shockwaves, clouds, stars etc..) and my favorite; the novel spin effect that occurs when the player turns.

I learned a lot while working on this one. To name a few... programming practices, source control, performance tuning, and most of all... going to release.

As a player, FEWAR hits many notes for me:

- The abstract themes in visuals, sounds, lore and overall purpose.
- Tight controls with satisfying physics.
- Progression is purely through skill aquired and lessons learned from previous failures. A motif in games that, for better or worse, has dulled in recent times.
- The notion that not everything need be explained.
