Noisy Bug Studios were a huge inspiration for me when starting out. Stepping on board with them to have a hand in developing FEWAR-DVD was an incredible experience. It's not often that you get to contribute to one of your favorite pieces of art.

I coded the input system, the menus, tech art (angular lighting, shockwaves, clouds, stars etc.), and my favorite addition; the novel spin effect that occurs when the player turns.

FEWAR-DVD is available on both [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769510/FEWARDVD/) and [itch.io](https://dev-dwarf.itch.io/fewar-dvd)
