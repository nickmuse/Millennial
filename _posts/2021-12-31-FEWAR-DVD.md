Noisy Bug Studios were a huge inspiration for me when starting out. Stepping on board with them to have a hand in developing FEWAR-DVD was an incredible experience. It's not often that you get to contribute to one of your favorite pieces of art.

I helped code the input system, the menus, the tech art (angular lighting, shockwaves, clouds, stars etc..) and my favorite contribution; the novel spin effect that occurs when the player turns.

I learned a lot while working on this one. To name a few... good programming practices, source control, performance tuning, and going to release.

As a player, FEWAR hits many notes for me:

- The abstract themes in visuals, sounds, lore and overall purpose.
- Tight controls; coupled with satisfying, reliable physics.
- Progress sherely through the skill aquired and lessons learned from previous failures. A motif in video games that (for better or worse) may have had its last hurrah for now, as rogueLITES continue to dominate a landscape once occupied by rogueLIKES.
- The notion that not everything need be explained. And how sometimes, explaining nothing at all can permit the user to experience a different kind of curisosity, outside of conventional guardrails.
 
When you peel it all back, FEWAR-DVD is software and you are a neural network turning its knobs.

You're *told* what failure is. You *suspect* there exists a success. You *learn* that there's fun in bridging the gap.
