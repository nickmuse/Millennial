Working with Noisy Bug Studios to bring FEWAR-DVD online was an experience that allowed me to contribute to one of my favorite pieces of art.

I helped code the input system, the menus, the tech art (angular lighting, shockwaves, clouds, stars etc..) and my favorite; the novel spin effect that occurs as the player steers.

I learned a lot while working on thisâ€”thoughtful programming practices, source control, performance tuning, and, most valuably, going to release.

As a player, FEWAR resonates with me on several levels:

- Abstract themes in sounds, visuals, lore, and overall purpose.
- Tight controls and satisfying physics.
- Progression relies on real skill acquisition and lessons learned from failures, an increasingly rare motif in contemporary games.
- A feedback loop that plays to your curisotiy of the unexplained.
